Inheritance :
    i) The capability of a class to inherit the properties and charcaterstic from another class is known as inheritance.
    ii) Base class : The class whoose properties are inherited by sub class is called base class. or
    parent class or super class.
    iii) Derived class : The class who inherit the properties from parent class is known as derived class or child class or sub class.
    iv) It supports the concept of reusability. avoid redundancy, less loc and less time.
    v) It has (is a) relation. like dog is a child of animal.
    vi) Represents the parent-child relationship.

Modes of Inheritance :
    i) public mode 
    ii) private mode
    iii) protected mode

Example :
    i) Animal is a base class and dog,cat,cow is derved from base class known as derived class.
    ii) all the properties are Inherited from my dad. properties like money, genes, education

code in c++ :

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// Base class
class Parent {
public:
    int id_p;
};
 
// Sub class inheriting from Base Class(Parent)
class Child : public Parent {    // In case of java we use exyends keywords for accesing the data.
public:
    int id_c;
};
 
// main function
int main()
{
    Child obj1;
 
    // An object of class child has all data members
    // and member functions of class parent
    obj1.id_c = 7;
    obj1.id_p = 91;
    cout << "Child id is: " << obj1.id_c << '\n';
    cout << "Parent id is: " << obj1.id_p << '\n';
 
    return 0;
}

In java :
extends are used for classes and implements keyword is used for interface to inherit the propwerties.
In c++ :
we use access specifiers for inheriting tne properties.
