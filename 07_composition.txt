Composition :
    i) It (has a) relationship.
    ii) Both entities are dependent on each other.
    iii) One entity cannot exists without another entity.
    iv) It allows the reuse of code
    v) In java we can acheive multiple inheritance using composition.

Real Life example :
    If there is a library and in library there is a books so if library get destroyed then all the book also get destroyed and if boook are not there then it's not a library so both entities are dependent on each other.
    For example, a file containing in a folder, if the folder deletes all files inside will be deleted. The file can not exist without a folder.

Association :
    It can be one to one , one to many , many to one and many to many relationship. 
    composition and aggregation are two forms of Association

aggregation :
    It also has a relationship
    It is a unidirectional Association.
    Both entities are independent on each other.

real life example :
    For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
    For example, the relationship between a student and a department. The student may exist without a department.
